# Amawulire-1
Amawulire literally means News in the Luganda language. This android app was developed using Android Studio and themed
using Material Design. 

It fetches JSON data from New York Times and displays it in a card view. There is also a detail view for it.

NOTE: You might need to change the API keys if those do not work for you on initial run. 

Enjoy!
